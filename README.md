## Program Overview

Whether you are transitioning your career, seeking advancement, or looking to refresh your knowledge, this course will ensure you have the skills necessary to apply for a programming-heavy Master’s Degree. The aim of this course is to prepare students without a technical background to become eligible to apply to one of our select STEM Master’s degree programs.

The NYU Tandon Bridge program is taught by faculty members of the Computer Science department at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, who are accompanied by NYU Tandon Graduate student teaching assistants. The curriculum was designed such that you will gain the knowledge prerequisites for any of our select Master’s programs.

This non-credit certificate course is equivalent to 400 hours of learning and more than three courses containing topics in Computer Programming in C++, Object Oriented Design, Discrete Math, Data Structures and Algorithms, Principles of Operating Systems, and Introduction to Computer Networks



## Personal Suggestions

1. Dive into LeetCode as you begin the program. For questions you find challenging, seek insights from your TAs. Familiarize yourself not only with easy LeetCode challenges but also tackle medium ones. LeetCode is an excellent platform to grasp data structures and algorithms.
2. Give it your all. The program is intensive, with only a few reaching the finish line. However, it's immensely beneficial for interview prep and further studies in graduate school. So, absorb as much as you can and retain it.
3. Build strong connections with your bridge program peers. They'll be invaluable allies when you transition to the NYU Tandon MSCS.
4. While the bridge program is crucial, also invest time in learning other programming languages and relevant tech stacks. Upon joining Tandon, I promptly had to work with Java, Python, and other tech stacks.
5. If you're an **international** student, aim to excel. **STAND OUT**. The admission criteria for domestic and international students differ. A mere 'A' grade might not suffice. Strive to be among the **TOP** performers to secure a spot in NYU Tandon MSCS through the Bridge program. I am top two students in my last two exams, and I observed that some highly competent students with 'A' grades missed out.
6. Fully utilize your TAs. They are among Tandon's brightest. A select few get to be bridge program TAs. Seek their advice on future course selection, school experiences, LeetCode challenges, and application strategies. They were instrumental in guiding me.
7. Getting sick and want to omit when you in bridge program is normal. 
8. Never miss a class. Both Professor Daniel Katz-Braunschweig and Professor Ratan Dey are outstanding (though they ghosted my Tandon Bridge TA application). They are experts in their domains. Engage actively in classes, ask questions, and if English isn't your first language, review the recorded sessions.
9. Aim for perfect scores in the initial exams and strive to be among the top performers in the subsequent ones. I always prepared well in advance, sometimes up to 7 weeks ahead.



Wishing you the best! Looking forward to seeing you at Tandon!
