Proofs
4.1 Direct Proof:
Prove that the product of two odd integers is an odd integer
Prove ---Proof
Let x and y be two odd integers, we shall prove that their product x*y is an odd integer.
since x and y are two odd integers, x can be represented as k + 1, k is an integer. 
y can be represented as n + 1, n is an integer.
Then, take x = k + 1, y = n + 1 into xy, we can get xy = (k + 1) * (n + 1) = nk + n + k + 1
=(nk + n+ k) + 1
Because k and n are both integers, n*k will also be integer, nk + n + k would also be integer
Let g = nk + n + k. From above we know that g is an integer.
xy = nk + n + k + 1 = g + 1, therefore, xy can be represent as an integer plus one.
Therefore, xy would be an odd integer.
The product of two odd integers is an odd integer.

4.2 Proof by Contrapositive:
Prove that if n^2 is even, then n is even by contrapositive
Proof
Assume the hypothesis of the implication to be true.
Assume that n is an odd integer.
Show the implication:

We assumes that n is odd, we shall prove that n^2 is odd.
Since n is odd, n can be represent as k +1. k is an integer.
Take n = k + 1 into n^2, we got n^2 = (k + 1)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1;
Since k is an integer, then k^2 + 2k is also an integer.
Let d = k^2 +2k. From above we know that d is also an integer.
Therefore, n^2 = d + 1. D is an integer. n^2 is equal to an integer plus one.
By definition, n^2 is an odd integer
Therefore, if n is odd, then n^2 is also odd.
Having used a direct proof of the contrapositive statement, 
we can conclude that if n^2 is evem,then n is even.
If n^2 is even, then n is even.

4.2 Proof by Contradiction
Prove:
Asssume 3n+ 5 is odd, we shall prove that n is odd.
since 3n + 5 is odd, 3n + 5 can be represent as 2k + 1, k is an integer
then 3n + 5 = 2k + 1
2k = 3n + 4;
k = 3/2 * n + 2;
since n is odd, n can be represent as 2a + 1, a is an integer
k = 3/2(2a + 1) + 2;
k = 3a + 3.5
since a is an integer. 3a is also an integer. an integer + 3.5 cannot be an integer,
which contradict from what we assume.
Therefore, n cannot be even.
Thus, if 3n + 5 is odd, then n is odd.
