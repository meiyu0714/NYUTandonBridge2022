#### Combinatorics 1.1 Rules of Sum and product 

All important thing start with easy ones. 

##### The rule of sum

If task A can be performed in m ways, and task B can be performed in n ways, and the two tasks cannot be performed simultaneously(disjoint), then tasks A **OR** B can be performed in m + n ways. 

or 就要想到 + 

##### The Rule of Product

If task A can be performed in m ways, and task B can be performed in n ways, then tasks A and B can be performed in m*n ways.

eg. D = {coffee, orange juice}
M = {pancakes, eggs}
S = {bacon, sausage, hash browns} 

m*n ways
