## 2 Proof 

### 2.1 Mathematical definitions 

Even and odd: Even: x = 2k; Odd: x = 2k  +1; k is an integer

Parity: 同为odd or even, same parity; 一个odd 一个even, opposite parity.

rational number: 能写成 y ≠ 0 and r = x/y的就是rational number

 **x divides y is denoted x|y if x ≠ 0 and y = kx**   

但 任何数|0 都是true

12∤3：3不能被12整除 

3|12：12可以被3整除

x divides y => y\x; y is divided by x; y is the multiple of x, and x is a factor or divisor of y. 

Prime and Composite number

Prime: 质数 （质数必须大于1）

Composite Number：divisor有三个以上的数

Inequalities:  

x is **at least** c ≡ x is **greater than or equal to** c ≡ x ≥ c 

x is **at most** c ≡ x is **less than or equal to** c ≡ x ≤ c

### 2.2 Introduction to proofs

要记得proof开始要写 Proof： 结束后要在最后加个小黑色方块  ■

**Proofs of universal statements: proofs by exhaustion**

当domain很小的时候，可以穷尽的proof

**Proofs of universal statements: universal generalization**

##### Counterexamples

##### Proving existential statements

**constructive proof of existence**、 **nonconstructive proof of existence**

#### 2.3 Best practices and common errors in proofs

common keywords and phrases in proofs:

Thus, therefore; it follows that, hen, hence;

Suppose, 

since/ because we know that, then

By definition; By assumption

In other words;

gives, yields(用单词代替 = )，

写proof的标准：

1）开始和结束要用Proof： 和小黑方块标清楚

2）proof要用完整的句子写清楚

3）给读者标清每一步

4）每新增一个variable要清晰解释

常见错误：1）用单个例子代表全部 2）

第一句话怎么写： 
Let  x and y be real numbers such that x >0 and y >0, we shall show that ...

##### rational number direct proof

 常用证明方式：for any two real numbers, x and y, if x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0, then xy ≠ 0.

2.5 Proof by contrapositive

选择直接证明还是反向证明，取决于是从左到右简单还是从右到左简单。

De Morgan's laws and the contrapositive.

(A and B) is false if and only if A is false or B is false. 

(A or B) is false if and only if A is false and B is false.

 ¬C → (¬H1 ∨ ¬H2)

Assume that C is false and H1 is true. We shall show that H2 is false.

Assume that C is false and H2 is true. We shall show that H1 is false.

2.6 Proof by contradiction 

也叫 **indirect proof**，通过证明¬c = False证明 c = True. 

1. A proof by contradiction shows that assuming that the theorem is false leads to an inconsistency.

A proof by contrapositive 是特殊的indirect proof 

形式： p→ q. 通过证明¬q 能推导 ¬p

常见证明手段 

**If x is an integer and x2 is even, then x must also be even.**

**If r is rational, then r can be expressed as a ratio of two integers with no common factors.**

### Proofs by contrapositive of conditional statements with multiple hypotheses

hypothesis 1 + hypothesis 2 =》 conclusion 

证明 否conclusion + hypothesis1 =》 否 hypothesis 2



A **proof by contradiction** starts by assuming that the theorem is false and then shows that some logical inconsistency arises as a result of the assumption.

2.7 Proof by cases

即分情况证明： 如将for every integer的情况分为 odd 和 even 俩种情况

！cases之间可以有重叠，只要整个domain被cases全部包裹即可

例题 2.7.2（完整证明过程）

 **without loss of generality** 不失一般性
